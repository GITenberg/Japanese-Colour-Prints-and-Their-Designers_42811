        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the annals of
        art production the colour-prints designed by the master artists of
        the Ukiyoé school occupy a unique place. They represent a plebeian
        art which was not a spontaneous upgrowth from the soil, but, so to
        speak, a down-growth or offshoot from an old and highly developed art
        of aristocratic lineage.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This elder art had
        its fountain-head in ancient China. That country, during the Tang and
        the Sung dynasties (618-905, 960-1280), was the seat of an aesthetic
        movement during which painting and other arts reached an
        extraordinarily high development. To the works produced during this
        great flowering-time of art the Japanese painters of the classical
        schools turned for inspiration and enlightenment. These works were
        distinguished by singleness of purpose, rhythmic vitality, and
        synthetic coherence, and by a clear conception of the essential that
        goes far beyond anything elsewhere attained, and which, when fully
        apprehended, must inevitably force a revision of Western ideas and
        criteria.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The art of ancient
        China and of the earlier Japanese schools is an art refined, poetic,
        and intensive to the last degree. It is based upon profound
        understanding of aesthetic laws. The artists were carefully grounded
        in the fundamental principles that govern all art, whether Oriental
        or Occidental. The result of this training is apparent in the
        homogeneity of their works. In Europe very confused notions have
        prevailed as to what should be done and what is permissible in art.
        Not even the great artists have always seen clearly; had they done
        so, it cannot be doubted that Western achievement would have attained
        a much higher level than it has ever reached.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Japanese
        modifications of the ancient Chinese art its traditions <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page4">[pg 4]</span> and aesthetic ideals were
        sedulously preserved. With only rare exceptions, the artists—and
        under this head it is necessary to include potters, lacquerers,
        metal-workers, swordsmiths, and others—were drawn from the upper
        classes. Many of them were in the service of the daimyo, and did not
        sell their productions, but received from their noble patrons regular
        stipends in koku of rice. Seldom did any of their works find their
        way into the hands of the common people, who had little opportunity,
        therefore, to become familiar with them. Gradually, however, as the
        number of paintings, statues, and other art objects multiplied and
        the temples were filled with votive offerings, the classical art made
        its impress upon buildings, wearing apparel, and utensils of all
        sorts; its conventions and principles were laid hold of by all
        classes and became the heritage of the entire people.</p><a name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The social fabric
        in old Japan was one of sharp distinctions. At the upper end of the
        scale were the Emperor; the kuge, or court nobles; the daimyo, or
        lords of the two hundred and fifty-one provinces; and the samurai, or
        hereditary military men, from whom were recruited the officials,
        priests, and scholars. Between these and the lower classes was an
        almost immeasurable gulf. Highest among the heimen, or commoners,
        were the farmers. Below them were the artisans, and still lower were
        the merchants, innkeepers, servants, and the like; while lowest of
        all were the eta, or outcasts, a class comprising scavengers,
        butchers, leather-workers, and others engaged in what were considered
        degrading occupations.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Under the peaceful
        regime of the Tokugawa shoguns there was a sociological change that
        in the cities almost amounted to a transformation. The most salient
        feature was the rise of the tradesmen and artisans to wealth and
        power. Many places of amusement sprang up, restaurants and tea-houses
        multiplied, jugglers, story-tellers, musicians, and other itinerant
        entertainers found audiences in every street, fêtes were frequently
        held in the temple compounds, the theatre rose to a position of
        prominence, and the yukwaku, or courtesan quarters, with their medley
        of attractions, became established institutions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The art of the
        Ukiyoé was a direct outcome of the gay life of this time. The
        inception of the school dates back to the closing years of the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5">[pg 5]</span> sixteenth century,
        when a reaction set in against the Chinese classicism of the Ashikaga
        period. This manifested itself in the choice of Japanese instead of
        Chinese subjects, and in novel treatment in which features of both
        the classic Kano and Tosa styles were combined, but which in many
        respects broke away from academic traditions. The reputed leader of
        the revolt was Iwasa Shoi, better known as Matahei, son of the Daimyo
        of Itami; but other distinguished artists, notably Kano Sanraku, also
        painted pictures in the new manner, which was not then held to
        constitute a distinct school. The subjects being drawn from the life
        of the people, these pictures were called Ukiyoé. É is the Japanese
        term for a picture or drawing.<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1"
        href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> Ukiyo, as
        originally written, had a Buddhistic signification and was applied to
        the secular as distinguished from the ecclesiastical world. Literally
        the word means <span class="tei tei-q">“the miserable world,”</span>
        but as now used it may be more accurately translated as <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the passing (or floating) world of every-day
        life.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Perhaps for the
        reason that Ukiyoé themes were not considered quite dignified, and
        because they did not express poetic ideas, the Ukiyo paintings of
        Matahei and his contemporaries and successors, though prized and much
        sought after, were seldom signed, and the identification of their
        authorship is a matter of extreme difficulty. For more than half a
        century works in this manner continued to be produced in considerable
        numbers, but the movement did not crystallize into a school until, in
        the person of Hishikawa Moronobu, a leader appeared to give it form
        and direction. Moronobu was an artist of rare distinction. His
        paintings were eagerly sought by the daimyos and the wealthier
        samurai. But Moronobu was a man of the people, and it was as a
        designer of book illustrations and later of ichimai-yé, or
        single-sheet prints, that he gave the impetus to Ukiyoé. For fifty
        years or more prior to his time books with engraved illustrations had
        been published in Japan, but they were comparatively few and the
        illustrations were poor and crudely executed. The twelve drawings
        Moronobu made for a book of instruction for women in etiquette and
        hygiene, published in 1659, marked a decided advance. This, so far as
        we know, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6">[pg 6]</span> was the
        first of a long series of books illustrated by him. Their popularity
        was deservedly great, and by them his fame became wide-spread. The
        illustrations were printed in black from blocks similar to those from
        which the text was printed, and were characterized by fine broad
        treatment and a rather wiry but strong and expressive outline.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">About 1670
        Moronobu began to issue large single-sheet prints which could be
        affixed to screens or mounted as kakemono. These prints, which were
        impressions in black from one block only, are known as
        sumi-yé—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sumi</span></em> being the Japanese name for
        Chinese—or, as we incorrectly call it, India—ink. They were designed
        to be coloured by hand, and apparently a part of the edition was so
        coloured before being placed on sale by the publishers. At first this
        colouring consisted of a few touches of yellow-green crudely laid on;
        later it became more elaborate, and occasionally we meet with prints
        that are very beautifully coloured, but in such cases it is
        impossible to tell when or by whom the colouring was done. The
        probability is that in some instances it was the work of purchasers
        of the prints.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moronobu's pupils,
        of whom there were many, devoted themselves almost exclusively to
        painting. After his death in 1695, the production of prints fell
        chiefly into the hands of Torii Kiyonobu and his son Torii Kiyomasu,
        two artists who take rank among the most talented men of the Ukiyoé
        school. Moronobu had taken for the subjects of his prints historic
        incidents, the manners and customs of the people, and, in particular,
        women and their occupations and amusements. To these the Torii
        artists, seeing a new and fertile field for the print-designer in the
        rise of the theatre as a popular form of entertainment, added
        portraits of actors in the costumes of their most admired rôles.
        Especially esteemed were Kiyonobu's portraits of the first
        DanjuÌroÌ. During the Genroku period (1688-1704) the people
        developed a passion for the theatre that amounted to veritable
        madness. In the first quarter of the eighteenth century this reached
        a height that sorely troubled the Tokugawa rulers. To check it
        various expedients—among them the exclusion of women from the
        stage—were tried. They only added fuel to the flame. Certain gross
        practices were abolished. This helped to purify the theatre, but also
        to perpetuate it by removing the seeds <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page7">[pg 7]</span> of what must inevitably have meant its early
        decay. Actors of distinguished ability became popular idols. Their
        comings and goings were like royal progresses. Wherever they went,
        were it to view the cherry blossoms at Ueno, for a boating party on
        the river, or for a visit to the Yoshiwara, they moved in state. Yet
        their rank in the social scale was so low that they were looked upon
        as little better than eta. The earliest actors were contemptuously
        termed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kawara-mono</span></em> (river-bed folk), from
        the fact that the first theatrical performances in Japan were upon a
        stage erected in the dry bed of the Kamogawa at Kyoto. The stigma
        that attached to their origin and to the vulgarity of the early
        performances has never been entirely lifted. Many of the Ukiyoé
        artists felt it a degradation to make drawings of actors.
        Nevertheless the popular demand created a supply, and for more than a
        century a large proportion of the enormous output of prints consisted
        of theatrical scenes and portraits of the performers.</p><a name=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many of the prints
        produced during the early years of the eighteenth century were large
        single figures of actors, geishas, and women of the Yoshiwara. These
        were broadly treated, with strong, free brush-strokes based upon the
        technique of the Kano masters and quite different from Moronobu's
        style, which was more nearly like that of the Tosa painters. Each of
        the classical schools, I may explain, had its own peculiar methods,
        for which brushes of special shape were required. In their
        spontaneity, their freedom, their glorious sweep of line, these
        prints are among the finest works of the Ukiyoé school. Among them
        are many masterpieces of linear composition. Yet by the people of the
        upper classes they were regarded as hopelessly vulgar. Though the
        Kano painters used similar sweeping strokes, they laid great stress
        upon carefully modulated tone. The notan, or lightness and darkness
        of the ink in different parts of the drawing, was an essential
        quality. It should not be confused with chiaroscuro, the science of
        light and shade. Notan signifies merely difference in lightness and
        darkness of tone. In the early prints this did not appear. All the
        lines were uniformly black. And the addition of colouring which was
        looked upon as coarse and gaudy was a further offence to persons of
        refined taste.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page8">[pg 8]</span>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our vision not
        being hampered by the canons of the Kano academy, we can appreciate
        the distinguished character of these compositions. Unquestionably the
        brush-work of a Sesshu, a Motonobu, or a Tanyu—to name a few only of
        the most eminent of the Japanese painters—has a precious quality not
        to be found in any printed line.<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2"
        href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a>
        Nevertheless the primitive Ukiyoé prints have a freshness and vital
        force peculiarly their own. The word <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“primitive”</span> as applied to these prints calls for a
        word of explanation. They are primitive, not in their art, which is
        highly developed, but merely as regards its application to
        wood-engraving.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The failure of
        Japanese connoisseurs to appreciate Ukiyoé art is not, however,
        entirely or even principally because of its technique. The art of the
        classical schools is deeply imbued with poetic feeling and usually is
        dignified in subject. Ukiyoé art, on the contrary, is flippant,
        whimsical, comic. Except when it deals with portraits, landscapes, or
        birds and flowers—subjects that are not strictly Ukiyoé—it is seldom
        that the things depicted are intended to be taken quite seriously. In
        nearly every picture there is some joke, open or cleverly hidden,
        some amusing fantasy in the shape of a modern analogue or travesty of
        popular myth, well-known tale, or historical event. Sly hits at the
        vices or follies of the aristocrats are not uncommon. A very large
        proportion of the subjects deals with the theatre and the denizens of
        the Yoshiwara. To the Japanese of the upper classes Ukiyoé art was a
        synonym for the art of the underworld. It is not surprising that they
        failed to appreciate its merit. To give Ukiyoé paintings or prints an
        honourable place in one's house was a confession of lack of taste.
        Were there no other reason, the subjects for the most part rendered
        them unfit, if not impossible. The prints were indeed amusing, and
        therefore many of them were saved; but they were looked upon much as
        we regard the pictures in our comic periodicals. Even when the art in
        these is good, it is hard to disassociate it from the humour and to
        enjoy it for itself alone. More commonly we fail to appreciate it as
        art or even to think of it as such. So it was with the prints. To the
        Japanese they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page9">[pg 9]</span>
        appeared little better than children's toys. In considering this we
        should not overlook the important circumstance that when first
        printed they were in general less charming than they are to-day. The
        wonderful colour that makes them so entrancing has come in large
        measure through the mellowing influence of time. Not infrequently
        this has wrought transformations that would seem incredible did not
        close study show clearly the changes that have taken
        place.</p><a name="fig7" id="fig7"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Even to-day
        inherited prejudice prevents wide-spread appreciation of the prints
        in the land of their origin. Our enthusiastic admiration is still
        more or less a mystery to our neighbours across the Pacific. Only
        now, when most of the fine prints have passed into the hands of
        European and American collectors, are the Japanese connoisseurs
        beginning to understand how it is that the Western art-lover,
        unfettered by any traditional point of view and not disturbed by any
        meanings the subject may hold or suggest, is able to perceive the
        glorious colour, the superb composition, the masterly treatment and
        rare beauty to which they have been blind.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The history of art
        is everywhere among civilized peoples a record of the influence of a
        succession of ideas, each in turn dominating for a longer or a
        shorter period the character of what is produced. When an idea has
        sufficient vitality to constitute the germ of a specific type of art,
        and artists of creative genius are inspired by it, the votaries
        working under the stimulus of a common ideal form what we designate
        as a school. <span class="tei tei-q">“When left to pursue its course
        of development unchecked,”</span> each marked type of art, as John
        Addington Symonds pointed out in one of his essays, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“passes through stages corresponding to the embryonic,
        the adolescent, the matured, the decadent, and the exhausted,”</span>
        This sequence, he showed, was clearly marked in the evolution of
        Italian painting, the Attic and the Elizabethan drama. Any of the
        classic schools of Japanese painting, the Kosé, the Yamato, the
        Sesshu, or the Kano, would furnish an excellent illustration, though
        in studying these movements it would be necessary to follow them back
        to their Chinese antecedents. The Ukiyoé school affords a
        particularly striking example. In the works of the earlier
        artists—Moronobu, Kiyonobu, Kiyomasu, and the KwaigetsudoÌ group—we
        find <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page10">[pg 10]</span>
        superabundant vigour, swift inspiration, and splendid though
        sometimes brutal force. The note of prophecy that these works contain
        is found also in those of the next generation of artists, foremost
        among whom was Okumura Masanobu. The fire of enthusiasm still glows
        brightly, but more attention is paid to subtleties of style, to
        beauty of detail, and to the development of technical processes.
        Hand-coloured prints are superseded by those in which the colour as
        well as the black outline is printed. Ukiyoé has become an art of the
        printed pictures which in large measure have taken the place of
        paintings.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then, after a
        brief interval of eager experiment and rapid changes, comes the
        flowering-time, when a group of great artists turn out by the
        thousand works in which spiritual intensity is combined with grace,
        beauty, refinement of composition, and technical perfection. This is
        the epoch of Harunobu, ShunshoÌ, Shigemasa, Koryusai, Kiyonaga, and
        ShunchoÌ.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The decline of the
        initial impetus that brought the school into being is plainly
        apparent in the works of the next generation. Utamaro was an artist
        of the very first rank, whose genius cannot be gainsaid; Eishi and
        Toyokuni were only a little less brilliant; but it was their
        misfortune to come upon the scene when the cycle of animating ideas
        had been exhausted. Too virile to be content merely to echo the
        performances of their predecessors, they spent their energy in
        inventing variations upon the perfected type. It was the only course
        open to them, but it led steadily and swiftly downward, though
        neither the artists nor the people who gleefully applauded each
        successive innovation were conscious of the decadence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the
        appearance of still another generation of artists upon the scene, the
        degradation of the school was complete. Artistic feeling was obscured
        by blatant vulgarity and affectation. There was a steady letting down
        to the level of the popular taste, which was steadily lowered in
        consequence. The skill of the more able artists was expended in the
        production of works interesting chiefly as <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tours de
        force,</span></em> more remarkable for technical than for artistic
        merit; the tendency toward exaggerated drawing became more
        pronounced; colouring grew more crude, raw, and over-vivid.
        Coincident with this decline in the art of <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page11">[pg 11]</span> the Popular School was a change for the
        worse in the fashions of the time. Loud patterns for brocades and
        other fabrics came into vogue; garments became showy and elaborate;
        coiffures, more especially those of the demi-monde, were often
        startling in their extravagance. As the prints were accurate mirrors
        of contemporary life, in these changed fashions may be found a
        partial explanation of the inferiority of the works of the later men.
        The Ukiyoé RyuÌ was a school of design which laid its impress upon
        all of the arts. The prints were but one of its phases, though the
        principal and the most distinguished of them. The rise, culmination,
        and disintegration took place all along the line. Toward the middle
        of the nineteenth century the Ukiyoé school sank into the dotage of
        decrepitude, and then into the sleep from which there is no
        awakening. I choose this phrase deliberately. An art that is of the
        past can never be revived. We may strive to work in the style of
        Harunobu or of Kiyonaga. All we can do is to copy their forms and
        imitate their mannerisms. We cannot possibly get our inspiration from
        the same source as they; that dried up at the fountain-head long ago.
        The best work we can do in their style must necessarily lack creative
        force and be without a spark of real vitality.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Primarily the
        charm of the Ukiyoé colour-prints is due to the fact that the leading
        masters of the school were artists of exceptional power. It is also
        due to the fact that most of them<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3"
        href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> made
        print-designing their chief occupation, to which they devoted their
        thought, time, and skill, and that with rare exceptions they were
        less distinguished as painters.</p><a name="fig8" id="fig8"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From about 1670,
        when Moronobu began to issue single-sheet prints, until about 1742, a
        period of at least seventy years, the prints were in black outline
        and were coloured by hand. They were, in fact, cheap paintings. Early
        in the eighteenth century the chief pigment used in colouring them
        was red lead. The Japanese name for this pigment is tan, and the
        prints upon which it appears are designated as tan-yé. About 1710
        yellow and citrine were commonly used with the tan. Four or five
        years later a new style of hand-colouring, said to have been
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page12">[pg 12]</span> devised by Torii
        Kiyonobu, came into vogue and greatly modified the style in which the
        prints were designed. In place of tan he substituted beni, a very
        beautiful but fugitive red extracted from the saffron. This was used
        in combination with a greenish yellow (probably gamboge) and
        low-toned blues and purples. Finer details were introduced into the
        designs, and the colouring in general was more carefully done. In
        response to a growing demand for less expensive pieces smaller prints
        (hoso-yé) became common. To give brilliance to the pigments a little
        thin lacquer (urushi) was mixed with them, and, while wet, parts of
        the design were sprinkled with metallic powder, which was probably
        applied by blowing it through a small bamboo tube. These prints were
        known as urushi-yé, or lacquer prints. A little later the custom grew
        up of painting parts of the prints with black lacquer.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not until the year
        1742 did the practice begin of applying colour by impressions from
        flat wood blocks. Why the invention should have been so long delayed,
        and why, after it was once made, nearly fourteen years more should
        have elapsed before the number of colour-blocks was increased beyond
        two, are questions to which no certain answer is yet forthcoming. It
        is incredible that during the forty years when innumerable
        hand-coloured prints were issued no one should have conceived the
        idea of printing the colour as well as the black outline. Without
        doubt some practical difficulty connected with the printing stood in
        the way. Possibly the thing that awaited discovery was the trick of
        mixing rice paste with the colour to keep it from running. Or, as is
        more likely, it took a long while to discover a practical method of
        securing accurate register in impressions made upon damp paper which
        was liable to stretch or shrink during the printing process. Whatever
        the problem may have been, the honour of the solution is due to
        Okumura Masanobu. Being a publisher as well as an artist, he was no
        doubt alive to the economic advantage of a cheaper process and to the
        attraction of novelty. Some years earlier he had invented the
        hashira-yé, or pillar-print, and had also put forth a series of
        prints that show a fair understanding of the laws of linear
        perspective to which he gave the name of Ukiyé. Being an artist as
        well as a publisher, Masanobu perceived that the change in process
        called for a change in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page13">[pg
        13]</span> style of the designs. The very first of the new prints,
        therefore, were characterized by finer and more exquisite detail than
        was suitable for the hand-coloured editions. The colours used were
        beni and a soft green; and the name beni-yé, which had been applied
        to the hand-coloured prints in which beni was used, was also given to
        them. A happier selection of colours could not have been made. By
        thinning the red and modifying the hue of the green a wide range of
        effects was secured. Almost every possible combination and variation
        was tried during the fourteen or fifteen years that the beni-yé were
        in vogue. The world is far richer because of this long period before
        the number of colour-blocks was increased, since time was afforded to
        work out the decorative possibilities resulting from the limitation
        to two colours and black and white. This limitation demanded fine
        skill and creative resource in the invention of pattern and the
        distribution of the colours employed.<a id="noteref_4" name=
        "noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> The
        results achieved were remarkable. Until one has seen them it is
        impossible to realize that so much life and vivacity of colouring
        could be given by impressions from two blocks charged with rose and
        green.</p><a name="fig9" id="fig9"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By many the
        beni-yé are regarded as the choicest products of the school. So
        charming were they when first printed that they speedily drove the
        urushi-yé prints out of the market, with the exception of the tall
        hashira-yé, or pillar prints, of which hand-coloured editions
        continued to be produced for a year or two, to satisfy those who
        still wished paintings rather than prints. Most of the beni-yé that
        have survived until our time are very much faded. The beni has quite
        generally turned into a soft yellow or disappeared altogether. The
        green is more stable, but that also has in many instances become a
        warm citrine or russet. Extremely rare are the specimens in which the
        original colour has not suffered material modification.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the testimony
        of the prints themselves it appears probable that very soon after
        Okumura Masanobu issued the first prints in beni and green, similar
        prints were put forth by Nishimura Shigenaga, Ishikawa <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page14">[pg 14]</span> Toyonobu, Torii Shiro
        (otherwise Kiyonobu the second), and all the Yedo print-designers,
        among them the veteran Torii Kiyomasu. None of these men seems to
        have attempted any marked departure from the type established by
        Okumura. About 1755, however, a group of young men appeared upon the
        scene, who were fired with zeal for further experiments. The leaders
        were Torii Kiyomitsu, Kitao Shigemasa, and Suzuki Harunobu. Kiyomitsu
        began by trying novel colour schemes such as two tones of beni
        instead of beni and green. Then he tried a third colour-block. After
        this new developments followed in rapid succession. The variety and
        range of the colour schemes broadened almost from day to day. At
        first the wider resources proved an embarrassment, but the mastery
        attained in dealing with the simpler means soon enabled the artists
        to take advantage of them. Invention was stimulated. In 1764 a
        printer named Kinroku discovered a method by which printing in
        colours from many blocks became possible. We can only guess at the
        nature of the difficulty that was surmounted; but as it is known that
        the printing was usually done upon dampened paper, it is evident that
        the stretching or shrinking of the sheets, to which I have already
        referred, must have proved extremely troublesome, and that every
        additional block must have multiplied the liability to defective
        register. It is reasonably safe to assume, therefore, that to find
        some means of overcoming this was the problem which remained unsolved
        for so many years.</p><a name="fig10" id="fig10"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The name of Suzuki
        Harunobu is familiar to every admirer of Japanese prints. It is in
        large measure to his genius that the development of full-colour
        printing is due. He was not only the first artist to make use of the
        new process, but he took advantage of it to bring out prints of a
        novel type. Very dainty and graceful these were, and in the poetic
        allusions or quiet humour with which they were charged, and in the
        quality of the brush-strokes with which the drawings were executed,
        they made a direct appeal to men of taste. Success was instantaneous.
        By the year 1765 Harunobu had come to the front and distanced all
        competitors for popular favour. The serenity and compelling charm of
        his compositions brought him wide fame. Realizing the possibilities
        that now lay before him, he proudly exclaimed, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Why should I degrade <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page15">[pg 15]</span> myself by the delineation of actors?”</span>
        His ambition, he said, was to become <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        true successor of the painters in the department of printing”</span>;
        that is to say, to design prints that should be worthy substitutes
        for paintings. Instead of restricting himself to a few primary or
        secondary hues and the variations resulting from their superposition,
        he mixed his colours to get the precise tint desired, and he used as
        many colour-blocks as were needed for the effects at which he aimed.
        The Yedo-yé, or Yedo pictures, as the prints had been called from the
        fact that they were produced only at the eastern capital, were now
        denominated nishiki-yé, or brocade pictures, from the number of
        colours woven together in them. To the printing itself, the charging
        of the blocks with colour, the character and quality of the pigments
        and of the paper used, Harunobu gave careful attention, and these
        things were greatly improved as a result of his experiments.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Under his
        leadership the art now entered upon the period of its greatest
        triumphs. In the eager search for novel subjects scarcely anything
        was left untouched. History, mythology, and romance, the numberless
        fêtes and merrymakings of the people and the daily routine of their
        lives, representations of celebrated poets and heroes, scenes from
        the drama, portraits of popular actors and courtesans, the revels of
        the Yoshiwara, animals and plants, familiar scenes and famous
        landscapes, furnished motives for almost endless broadsheets and book
        illustrations. No other art was ever more crowded with human
        interest.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The forward
        movement in print-designing at this epoch was helped on by a number
        of highly gifted artists who seem to have worked together to some
        extent. Katsukawa ShunshoÌ, who took up the theatrical branch of
        print-designing that Harunobu scorned, is one of the most
        distinguished masters of the Ukiyoé school. He was a designer of
        marked power, a colourist of the first rank. His works are not yet
        appreciated as they should be, but the finest of them yield pure
        aesthetic delight of most exalted quality. Kitao Shigemasa,
        Ippitsusai BunchoÌ, and Isoda Koryusai also rank among the
        first-rate men of this period. In the contest for popular favour
        during the ten years following the death of Harunobu, which took
        place in the summer of 1770, it has been said that the guerdon rested
        upon Koryusai, but that is a mistake, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page16">[pg 16]</span> for both ShunshoÌ and Shigemasa stood higher
        in the estimation of qualified judges. All, however, were surpassed a
        few years later by Kiyonaga, the last great artist of the Torii line
        and the culminating figure in the history of the Popular School. He
        conquered by the rugged strength and marvellous quality of his
        brush-strokes, by the richness of his colouring and the ripe mastery
        he displayed over all the resources of his craft. But also he created
        a new type of design—that which found expression in the great
        diptychs and triptychs that stand as the triumphs of colour-printing.
        At the height of his power his influence over his contemporaries was
        so great that, without exception, the younger men among them copied
        his style as closely as they could.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Kiyonaga,
        about 1793, stopped designing prints, the decadence had already set
        in. The decade that followed was a period of rapid deterioration,
        with Utamaro as its particular evil genius. Yet many of the most
        splendid of the prints were produced in that decade. Where shall we
        look for anything finer than Eishi's wonderful series with the
        chocolate background, or his triptychs of the Prince Genji series?
        Where shall we find anything to equal the brilliant characterization
        of Sharaku's actor portraits? Where else shall we turn for such
        marvellously facile rhythmic line, such swift, vital handling as that
        which made Utamaro's masterpieces the despair of his many imitators?
        Toyokuni also designed many fine prints; but as he was a man of less
        force than the others I have named, he fell faster and farther than
        they did, and fewer of his works command our admiration.</p><a name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have left myself
        little time to speak of two eminent artists, both of them
        world-renowned, who by their genius made the latter years of the
        Ukiyoé school as notable in their way as any in its entire history.
        Either Hokusai or Hiroshige might well engage our attention for an
        entire evening. Both were extraordinarily prolific; Hokusai was the
        more versatile and has the wider reputation. Both are among the
        greatest landscape artists the world has ever known. Their numerous
        prints of landscapes are a revelation of the possibilities of
        originality in composition and variety of interest in this field.
        Unless one has studied these prints in fine examples, it is
        impossible to realize how great is their <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page17">[pg 17]</span> merit. This is true of all the prints, but
        particularly true of Hiroshige's. Between the best impressions and
        the very good ones the difference is really astonishing. But the best
        are so extremely rare as to make it probable that because of the
        difficulty and the cost of printing, very few of them were issued—the
        publishers finding cheaper editions more profitable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though classed as
        Ukiyoé artists, Hokusai and Hiroshige really represent a separate
        movement which undoubtedly would have crystallized into a distinct
        school had worthy followers arisen to carry it forward, had the times
        been different, and, last but not least, had the genius of the two
        masters been less transcendent.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this sketch of
        the history of the art of Ukiyoé colour-printing only the more
        salient features have been touched upon. Of the prints themselves it
        is not too much to say that the finest of them are the most beautiful
        specimens of printing that have been done in any land at any
        time.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet none but the
        most primitive methods—or what from our point of view may seem
        such—were employed. The most wonderful among all the prints is but a
        <span class="tei tei-q">“rubbing”</span> or impression taken by hand
        from wood blocks. The artist having drawn the design with the point
        of a brush in outline upon thin paper, it was handed over to the
        engraver, who began his part of the work by pasting the design face
        downward upon a flat block of wood, usually cherry, sawn plankwise as
        in the case of the blocks used by European wood-engravers in the time
        of Dürer. The paper was then scraped at the back until the design
        showed through distinctly in every part. Next, the wood was carefully
        cut away, leaving the lines in relief, care being taken to preserve
        faithfully every feature of the brush-strokes with which the drawing
        was executed. A number of impressions were then taken in Chinese ink
        from this <span class="tei tei-q">“key block”</span> and handed to
        the artist to fill in with colour. This ingenious plan, which is
        manifestly an outgrowth of the early custom of colouring the ink
        prints (sumi-yé) by hand, and which perhaps would never have been
        thought of had not the colour itself been an afterthought, enabled
        the artist to try many experiments in colour arrangement with a
        minimum amount of labour. The colour scheme and ornamentation of the
        surfaces having been determined, the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page18">[pg 18]</span> engraver made as many subsidiary blocks<a id=
        "noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> as were
        required, the parts meant to take the colour being left raised and
        the rest cut away. Accurate register was secured by the simplest of
        devices. A right-angled mark engraved at the lower right-hand corner
        of the original block, and a straight mark in exact line with its
        lower arm at the left, were repeated upon each subsequent block, and,
        in printing, the sheets were laid down so that their lower and
        right-hand edges corresponded with the marks so made. The defective
        register which may be observed in many prints was sometimes caused by
        unequal shrinking or swelling of the blocks. In consequence of this,
        late impressions are often inferior to the early ones, even though
        printed with the same care, and from blocks that had worn very
        little. The alignment will usually be found to be exact upon one side
        of the print, but to get further out of register as the other side is
        approached.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The printing was
        done on moist paper with Chinese ink and colour applied to the blocks
        with flat brushes. A little rice paste was usually mixed with the
        pigments to keep them from running and to increase their brightness.
        Sometimes dry rice flour was dusted over the blocks after they were
        charged. To this method of charging the blocks much of the beauty of
        the result may be attributed. The colour could be modified, graded,
        or changed at will, the blocks covered entirely or partially. Hard,
        mechanical accuracy was avoided. Impressions differed even when the
        printer's aim was uniformity. Sometimes, in inking the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“key block,”</span> which was usually the last impressed,
        some of the lines would fail to receive the pigment, or would be
        overcharged. This was especially liable to happen when the blocks
        were worn and the edges of the lines became rounded. A little more or
        a little less pigment sometimes made a decided difference in the tone
        of the print, and, it may be noted, has not infrequently determined
        the nature and the extent of the discolouration wrought by
        time.</p><a name="fig12" id="fig12"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In printing, a
        sheet of paper was laid upon the block and the printer rubbed off the
        impression, using for the purpose a kind of pad called <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page19">[pg 19]</span> a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">baren.</span></em>
        This was applied to the back of the paper and manipulated with a
        circular movement of the hand. By varying the dampness of the paper
        and the degree of pressure the colour could be forced deep into the
        paper, or left upon the outer fibres only, so that the whiteness of
        those below the surface would shine through, giving the peculiar
        effect of light which is seen at its best in some of the surimono
        (prints designed for distribution at New Year's or other particular
        occasions) by Hokusai and his contemporaries. Uninked blocks were
        used for embossing portions of the designs. The skill of the printer
        was a large factor in producing the best results. Even the brilliancy
        of the colour resulted largely from his manipulation of the pigments
        and various little tricks in their application. The first impressions
        were not the best, some forty or fifty having to be pulled before the
        block would take the colour properly. Many kinds of paper were used.
        For the best of the old prints it was thick, spongy in texture, and
        of an almost ivory tone. The finest specimens were printed under the
        direct personal supervision of the artists who designed them. Every
        detail was looked after with the utmost care. No pains were spared in
        mixing the tints, in charging the blocks, in laying on the paper so
        as to get the best possible impressions. Experiments were often tried
        by varying the colour schemes. Prints of important series, as, for
        example, Hokusai's famous <span class="tei tei-q">“Thirty-six Views
        of Fuji,”</span> are met with in widely divergent colourings.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The pigments most
        frequently used were comparatively few, and different lots of the
        same pigment seem to have been far from uniform in hue. As to this
        and some other points upon which we should be glad to have light, no
        very certain information exists. We do not know how soon some of the
        colours began to fade. Internal evidence indicates that in some
        instances the change took place within a comparatively short time, as
        in the case of the lovely blue used by Harunobu and ShunshoÌ chiefly
        as a colour for sky and water. It appears to have been a compound
        tint formed of blue mixed with some other colour to modify its
        intensity. In the change which followed—possibly a chemical one—the
        blue disappeared in whole or in part, leaving in its stead a buff hue
        having peculiar depth and a soft, velvety texture. To our
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page20">[pg 20]</span> eyes the modified
        colour is often far more beautiful than the original, but the
        variation, it may safely be asserted, was not desired by the
        artist.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The quality of the
        colour wrought by these changes explains why it is not possible
        to-day to reproduce the prints successfully. The printing process is
        still in use, and, as the plates in such publications as <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Kokka”</span> attest, very splendid results are still
        yielded by it. But some of the old pigments cannot now be obtained;
        and if they could be, we should still have to wait long years for
        time to mellow the prints made with them. Indigo can be had, but it
        is not the same indigo and its colour is not quite like the old,
        which was extracted from blue cloth imported from China. Beni can be
        made, but the secret of the blue added to it to produce the divine
        violet seen in many of the prints has been lost, as has that of the
        precious moss-green used by Utamaro. Many reproductions have been
        made during the last twenty-five years, and some of them are
        extremely clever; but the printing lacks depth, and when placed
        beside the old works they appear dull and lifeless.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Colour-prints were
        made for many purposes. To some extent they were used as
        advertisements. Incidentally they served as fashion plates. Some were
        regularly published and sold in shops. Others were designed expressly
        upon orders from patrons, to whom the entire edition—sometimes a very
        small one—was delivered. The number struck from any block, or set of
        blocks, varied widely. Of the more popular prints many editions were
        printed, each one, as might be expected, inferior to those that
        preceded it. Not infrequently the Yedo publishers removed from their
        out-of-date blocks the marks showing their imprint, and sold them to
        publishers in Osaka and Nagoya, by whom poor and cheap editions were
        issued. Eiraku-ya of Nagoya, in particular, is said to have bought
        many old blocks, some of which were revamped in various ways before
        being reprinted.</p><a name="fig13" id="fig13"></a>

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a number of
        instances, when blocks had worn out or had been accidentally
        destroyed in the fires by which Yedo was ravaged, the artists were
        called upon to make new drawings of the same subjects. Usually, in
        such cases, the second design differed very little from the first,
        save in such details as the patterns upon the garments of the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page21">[pg 21]</span> figures and the
        styles of hair arrangement, which invariably reflected the current
        mode. Kiyonaga's <span class="tei tei-q">“Iris Garden”</span> and his
        well-known triptych <span class="tei tei-q">“Ushiwaka Serenading
        Jorurihime”</span> are notable examples of this practice. Two designs
        of each of these were issued, the intervals between the appearance of
        the first and second being, in each instance, about three or four
        years. For the later editions of many of the prints designed by
        Harunobu changes were made in the blocks, and the number was
        sometimes increased and sometimes decreased. After his death
        re-engravings of a number of his prints appear to have been made, as
        well as forged works in imitation of his style to which his name was
        attached.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most of the prints
        were sold at the time of publication for a few sen. The finer ones
        brought relatively higher prices, and such prints as the great
        triptychs and still larger compositions by Kiyonaga, Eishi, Toyokuni,
        Utamaro, and other leading artists could never have been very cheap.
        In general, however, the price was small and they were regarded as
        ephemeral things. Many were used to ornament the small screens that
        served to protect kitchen fires from the wind, and in this use were
        inevitably soiled and browned by smoke. Others, made into kakemono or
        mounted upon the sliding partitions of the houses, perished in the
        fires by which Japanese cities have been devastated; or, if in houses
        that chanced safely to run the gauntlet of fires, typhoons,
        cloudbursts, and other mishaps, their colours faded and their
        surfaces were rubbed until little more than dim outlines were left.
        These lost prints include a very large proportion of those that were
        most beautiful, and especially of those having inoffensive
        subjects.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Fortunately,
        though the upper classes did not consider the prints as works of art,
        that did not prevent them from buying them for the entertainment they
        afforded. The samurai, though they considered it degrading to take
        part in the amusements of the lower classes and affected to despise
        the vulgarity of the theatre, sometimes attended the performances in
        disguise. And when they returned to their home provinces with their
        feudal lords after the six months of every year spent in the capital,
        they usually carried with them large quantities of prints. Country
        people visiting Yedo rarely returned without taking <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page22">[pg 22]</span> many of these cheap souvenirs
        of the city to distribute among their neighbours. Of course many were
        destroyed, but the Japanese have always been accustomed to take care
        of their possessions, and so many thousands of prints were neatly
        packed away in boxes and placed in the kuras, or fireproof
        storehouses. There they were often spoiled by mildew, the dread foe
        of the Japanese housewife, and eaten by insects. Those pasted in
        albums, as were many of the noted series by Hokusai and Hiroshige,
        fared better than the loose ones.</p><a name="fig14" id="fig14"></a>

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it has come
        about that in spite of the enormous number printed, really choice
        specimens are very rare. Of many of the most important only two or
        three copies in good condition are known. Even at the time of their
        issue the number of those in what may be called the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“proof”</span> state could not have been large. The best
        printing, as has already been pointed out, was not only difficult and
        relatively expensive—perhaps prohibitively expensive in many
        instances except for a small number of impressions—but when the
        blocks had worn so that the edges of the finest lines had lost their
        sharpness, it was quite impossible. Collections of prints were rarely
        made. Literary men often saved such as were inscribed with odes of
        especial merit, or had recondite meanings that appealed to them, and
        to their care we are indebted for the preservation of the majority of
        those that have survived in perfect or nearly perfect condition.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For those who have
        learned the elements of their language the charm of the prints is
        very great. I should perhaps say the charm of some of the prints is
        very great; for, as we learn what we ought to admire, we learn to
        discriminate, at first between the works of the different artists,
        then between different works by the same artist, and finally between
        different copies of the same work. The truth is that the prints are
        only in a remote sense to be spoken of as reproductions. Each
        impression is more or less an individual work of art; the difference
        in quality between one and another is often astonishingly wide.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In conclusion it
        may be well to specify briefly some of the qualities in the prints
        that appeal to people of taste. In the first place, there is the
        compelling charm of colour. Equally notable are excellence of
        composition, grace, beauty, and sweep of line, distinctive character,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page23">[pg 23]</span> daringness of
        conception, and perfect balance of both line and mass. Collectively
        the prints furnish the clearest exemplification of the basic
        principles of design that the world has to offer. Nowhere else can we
        find so much accomplished with simple means. Technically, also, they
        fulfil every requirement. Considered merely as wood-engravings, they
        are of the first order of excellence. Though the drawing is seldom
        scientifically accurate, it is, nevertheless, of exquisite refinement
        and subtlety. In short, the best prints are creative works of very
        high order which amply justify our admiration because of their
        intrinsic merit.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page24">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The leading
          masters of the Ukiyoé school were a group of very great artists.
          The names of Kiyonaga, Harunobu, Okumura Masanobu, Utamaro,
          Hokusai, and Hiroshige belong in the category of those whose fame
          is world-wide.</p><a name="fig20" id="fig20"></a>

            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The finest of
          the colour-prints designed by these men and their fellow-artists
          are masterpieces of rare distinction. This does not mean that all
          of their works should be so classed. The method by which the prints
          were produced enabled the artists to turn them out rapidly, and
          many were made that were trivial in character. They served almost
          as many purposes in their time as engravings, etchings,
          lithographs, and the photographic process reproductions do with us
          to-day. Naturally they varied widely in merit and in quality. Many
          have been preserved, but the important prints by the greater
          artists are unfortunately very rare; few of them have survived the
          vicissitudes of time, and fewer still in good condition.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The inception of
          the Ukiyoé school dates back to the early years of the seventeenth
          century, when a painter named Iwasa Matahei, departing from the
          traditional subjects of the painters of the classic schools, made
          pictures of dancing-girls and scenes of every-day life. The first
          prints were made about 1660 by Hishikawa Moronobu and were in
          simple black outline. They were sometimes coloured by hand with a
          few touches of colour roughly laid on, probably by the publisher's
          assistants.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the early
          years of the seventeenth century a style of colouring known as
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tan-yé</span></em> (from the predominant use
          of a red-lead pigment known as tan) came into vogue. A little later
          prints were sold with more elaborate hand-colouring. Lacquer was
          mixed with the pigments to give them brilliancy, and the prints
          were known as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">urushi-yé,</span></em> or lacquer prints. In
          or about the year 1742 Okumura Masanobu began <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page28">[pg 28]</span> to make the first true
          colour-prints. For these he used only two colours, green and a soft
          red called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">beni,</span></em> and the prints were known as
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">beni-yé.</span></em> For some years
          difficulties connected with the printing prevented the use of more
          than two colour-blocks, and not until 1764 was a method discovered
          which made it possible to use as many blocks as might be required.
          Suzuki Harunobu was the first artist to take advantage of the
          discovery. The prints designed by him during the next six years are
          among the finest works of the school. Under his guidance and that
          of Katsukawa Shunsho, the art of colour-printing was brought to
          perfection. Then followed a period when many prints of precious
          quality were produced. The culmination was reached during the
          seventeen hundred and eighties, when Torii Kiyonaga turned out his
          marvellous single sheets, diptychs, and triptychs.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many splendid
          prints were designed in the next decade. It was then that Eishi
          made his delightful triptychs, that Sharaku stirred the people of
          Yedo with his wonderful caricature portraits of popular actors, and
          that Utamaro gained wide fame by the products of his facile brush.
          It was, however, a period of decadence, and by the end of the
          century a considerable distance had been travelled upon the
          downward path.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The prints made
          in the nineteenth century were, for the most part, coarse and
          gaudy, the chief exceptions being those designed by Hokusai and
          Hiroshige. These men, though classed as of the Ukiyoé school, in
          reality represent what may more properly be termed another
          <span class="tei tei-q">“movement”</span> growing out of, but
          distinct from, the Ukiyoé art that reached its apogee under
          Kiyonaga.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the
          present exhibition includes specimens of most of the different
          kinds of prints—some of them, more especially the earlier ones, of
          extreme rarity—historical completeness has not been attempted. The
          aim has been rather to show such prints of exceptional quality and
          beauty as are available in New York.</p>

            important pupil of Harunobu, whose style he followed closely in
            his early works. Later he developed a manner of his own. As a
            designer of pillar prints and of prints of birds, he was
            especially successful. He was a samurai and associated with
            samurai of the superior class. The director of the mint was one
            of his most intimate friends and patrons. About 1781 he gave up
            print-designing, devoted himself to painting, and was given the
            honorary title of Hokyo. The dates of his birth and death are not
            known.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
              electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
              computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new
              computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of
              volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Volunteers
              and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance
              they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s goals
              and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain
              freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
              Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a
              secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
              generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check
